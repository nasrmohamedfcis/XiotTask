In this app i hoped to make a good and reliable app that utilises the MQTT protocol in sending and recieving messages.
I thought at first that the task wont be completed but i managed to finish it probably. 
now i have learned whats is MQTT protocol and how to use it inside an android app , also i get to know how to search probably for a solution
and how to use stackoverflow and github in a more effiecient way.
